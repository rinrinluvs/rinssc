        <h1>The Cua: Origins</h1>
        <h2>The Origin of the Cua</h2>
        <img src="https://placehold.co/200x200" alt="Picture of the Great Revolution" class="img_float" style="--floatwhere: right;">
        <p>As the Caca Era drew to a close, the Cua emerged. Though they appeared weak, the Cua went on to rule the entire world. At first other races treated the Cua as "slaves," blaming them for major disasters, crimes, and diseases. They had almost no rights and faced constant abuse from the Potaixi, who ruled the land. But the Cua had hidden strength and toughness that few saw coming. Over time, they started a quiet but powerful uprising driven by their wish to be free and their need for fairness. Cua people began to whisper about fighting back, and small acts of disobedience grew into organized resistance. The once meek and beaten-down Cua found their courage and began to stand up to the cruel system that had kept them down for so long. The big change came when a young Cua leader named Lira stepped up. She gave moving speeches and showed strong resolve inspiring her people to action. Lira's call for unity and strength struck a chord with the downtrodden rekindling a flicker of optimism that had been snuffed out long ago. The Cua rallied behind Lira forming a tough group that used their deep understanding of the terrain and their incredible toughness to outsmart the clueless Potaixi rulers. They chose hit-and-run tactics and planned attacks as their go-to methods scaring those who used to look down on them. Each win made the Cua braver and more rebellious, as they took back their pride and claimed their rightful spot in the world. The once-mighty Potaixi empire fell apart due to their own pride unable to handle the non-stop attacks from a people united in their goal and driven by a need for fairness. As the fighting died down and peace returned, a new age began for the world. The Cua once beaten down and pushed aside now stood proud as shapers of their own future, their unbreakable spirit shining as a ray of hope for anyone who had ever faced oppression. History would remember the rise of the Cua as a constant testimony to the undying power of resilience, unity, and an unyielding pursuit of freedom. That triumph was to remind one that even the weakest amongst them would surge into greatness when fueled by the fire of justice, joined in unbreakable bonds of solidarity.        </p>
        <h2>The Prophet Sup, The Dominator of Sea, The House of Cream, The Progenitor's Servant</h2>
        <img src="https://placehold.co/200x200" alt="The Prophet Sup, The Dominator of Sea, The House of Cream, The Progenitor's Servant ascending onto the land" class="img_float"
            style="--floatwhere: left;">

        <p>
            The Prophet Sup, a Dominator of the Sea, lived in the mysterious House of Cream, ready to serve instantly by his master, the Progenitor, at any time. His presence called for respect; his words, laced with the weight of centuries of insight and prophecy, rumbled throughout the lands.

            In the silent halls of House Cream, with carvings and glittering tapestries, Sup held court, gave prophecies that designed the fate of nations and people. His eyes, in their intensity and depth, seemed almost to cut through the veil of time and show what had been and what was to be.
            
            Those who sought his counsel were met with riddles and insightful answers, every word layered with meaning available only to the most enlightened. And thus, the Servant of the Progenitor, bound by an ancient oath of servitude, was dutifully discharging the burden of his devotion, shining as a beacon of unswerving loyalty in a world riddled with uncertainty.
            
            The leg-ends spoke about Sup being able to communicate with the spirits of the deep, that his visions would come with the tide and go with it, and his wisdom was as wide as the endlessness of the ocean. During turmoil and upheaval, his prophecies would cast a glimmer of hope-a light to lead through the darkness shrouding men's hearts.
            
            As the Servant of the Progenitor, Sup carried with him a legacy reaching back through the mists of time and a mantle of responsibility well borne by him in grace and humility. In his presence, mortals would quake because they knew that they were in the presence of a being touched by the divine, a conduit through which the will of the ancients would be manifest.
            
            Thus, the Prophet Sup rose as the Ruler over the Sea, the Cream House, the Servant of the Progenitor-a column of strength and wisdom in a world on the eve of chaos. His legacy would outlive him by the time his mortal form would be reunited with eternal sea.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the Caca Era, many Cua were treated like trash. As <em>The Prophet Sup, The Dominator of Sea, The House of Cream, The Progenitor's Servant</em> was chained behind bars in the Shackling Realm, <em>The Prophet Sup, The Dominator of Sea, The House of Cream, The Progenitor's Servant</em> was forced to watch his dear master's descendants suffer a harsh and miserable life, for several millenia. <em>The Prophet Sup, The Dominator of Sea, The House of Cream, The Progenitor's Servant</em>, however, was not angry at the Floptropicans (the Potaixi's predecessors). When <em>The Prophet Sup, The Dominator of Sea, The House of Cream, The Progenitor's Servant</em> was finally out of the Shackling Realm, <em>The Prophet Sup, The Dominator of Sea, The House of Cream, The Progenitor's Servant</em> instead gave those Floptropicans salvation by a painless unaliving.
