  <h1>A message from the Head Priest, <b>Father Banhcanh Cua</b></h1>
  
  <p>Welcome, fellow sisters, brothers. I have received a divine revelation that our sisters and brothers, our faithful devotees require a website. With this website, I hope to spread the gospel of our holy lord, Banh Canh Cua. With their beautifulness, thickness, and slurpability, they outshine the heretics and fake gods we know as the Bun Mang Vit and Mi Quang.</p>
  <p>
  A divine revelation has told me that people tend to prefer reading on the internet, so I have enlisted one of our most faithful believers, Sister Sup Cua to create a divine website that will allow sisters and brothers from the interwebs to use our holy book, the Divine Cua. In this website are events ("Events") which happened from thoughout, the origin of the god Banh Canh Cua ("Lore"). We hope your belief will be greater than the stars, and brighter than the sun.
  </p><p>
  May the Cua take over us. Slurp slurp slurp.
